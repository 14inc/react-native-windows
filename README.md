# React Native Examples

This branch is the result of a git-filter-branch operation on the Examples subdirectory from the [facebook/react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository.  We use this branch to populate the examples for [ReactWindows/react-native-windows](http://github.com/ReactWindows/react-native-windows).

This branch is manually rebased off the latest from the upstream repository, so if there are core changes to any of these examples that are not specifically meant to get them working on Windows, please be sure to contribute them upstream instead of here.

Here is a summary of the examples:
* [2048](2048) - A popular touch-based number puzzle game.
* [Movies](Movies) - A list app that searches [IMDB](http://imdb.com).
* [TicTacToe](TicTacToe) - You should probably know this one.
* [UIExplorer](UIExplorer) - An aggregation of examples using core view managers and modules.
